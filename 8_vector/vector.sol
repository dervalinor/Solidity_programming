//GitHub CLI 
//gh release create: gh release create is a subcommand of the gh release command in GitHub CLI that allows you to create a new release for a repository
//You can specify a tag for the release and provide a list of asset files to upload to the new release. If a matching git tag does not yet exist, one will automatically be created from the latest state of the default branch
//Here is an example of how to use gh release create:

//gh release create <tag> [<files>...]
//Replace <tag> with the desired tag for the release. You can also provide a list of asset files to upload to the new release.

//For example, to create a new release with the tag v1.0.0 and upload an asset file named my-asset.zip, you would run:

//gh release create v1.0.0 my-asset.zip

//what is release?
//In the context of software development and version control, a release is a version of a software project that is made available for distribution to users. Releases are often associated with a specific version number or tag and may include pre-built binaries, source code archives, and other assets.

//On GitHub, you can create releases for your repositories to provide packaged software, release notes, and binary files for other people to use. Releases are based on Git tags, which mark a specific point in your repositoryâ€™s history. When you create a release, you can associate it with a specific tag and provide additional information such as release notes and links to download the software.
