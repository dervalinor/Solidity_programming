//Here are some code challenges for beginners in Solidity:

//Create a simple counter contract. The contract should have a 
//variable that stores the number of times it has been called. 
//When the contract is called, the variable should be incremented.

//Create a simple mapping contract. The contract should have a 
//mapping that stores a list of key-value pairs. When the contract is called, 
//it should allow users to add, update, and delete key-value pairs from the mapping.

//Create a simple event contract. The contract should have an event 
//that is fired whenever it is called. The event should have 
//a name and a list of arguments.

//Create a simple contract that implements a basic token. 
//The contract should have a variable that stores the total supply of tokens.
// When the contract is called, it should allow users to transfer tokens to each other.

//The `gh release create` command is used to create a new release for a repository on 
GitHub from the command line. Here's an example of how you can use it:


```sh
gh release create <tag> --title "Release title" --notes 
"Updated compiler version to 0.8.19 and added SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT license"
```

`<tag>`: This is the tag for the release. It marks a specific point in your repository's history.
`--title "Release title"`: This sets the title of the release to "Release title".
`--notes "Updated compiler version to 0.8.19 and added SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT license"`: This sets the release notes to 
"Updated compiler version to 0.8.19 and added SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT license".
