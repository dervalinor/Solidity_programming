//Here are some code challenges for beginners in Solidity:

//Create a simple counter contract. The contract should have a 
//variable that stores the number of times it has been called. 
//When the contract is called, the variable should be incremented.

//Create a simple mapping contract. The contract should have a 
//mapping that stores a list of key-value pairs. When the contract is called, 
//it should allow users to add, update, and delete key-value pairs from the mapping.

//Create a simple event contract. The contract should have an event 
//that is fired whenever it is called. The event should have 
//a name and a list of arguments.

//Create a simple contract that implements a basic token. 
//The contract should have a variable that stores the total supply of tokens.
// When the contract is called, it should allow users to transfer tokens to each other.
